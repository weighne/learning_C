# Learning C
## Introduction / Background

I'm going to try my best to document my 'journey' learning C.

I've tossed the idea around for a while, figured there was no time better than now. So, this is Day 1. I've got very little knowledge of programming outside of some limited python knowledge. Hopefully this goes well!

## Day 1

My environment is set up on my work and home computers and tested with the usual 'hello world,' everything seems to be working!

I'd like to learn to do some basic input and output, maybe throw together a little hangman game or something like that... we'll see.
