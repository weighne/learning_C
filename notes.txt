# Learning C
## Introduction / Background

I'm going to try my best to document my 'journey' learning C.

I've tossed the idea around for a while, figured there was no time better than now. So, this is Day 1. I've got very little knowledge of programming outside of some limited python knowledge. Hopefully this goes well!

## Start of Day 1

My environment is set up on my work and home computers and tested with the usual 'hello world,' everything seems to be working!

I'd like to learn to do some basic input and output, maybe throw together a little hangman game or something like that... we'll see.

I am following along with some of the tutorials on this website because they're seemingly pretty straightforward and decent at explaining the basics without freaking me out: https://www.guru99.com/c-programming-tutorial.html

Learning string comparisons: very different from python. 'strcmp' lets me compare two strings for matching contents and returns '0' if things match. No more [ if x == y ] for everything under the sun, probably a good thing to get used to...
