# Learning C
## Introduction / Background

I'm going to try my best to document my 'journey' learning C.

I've tossed the idea around for a while, figured there was no time better than now. So, this is Day 1. I've got very little knowledge of programming outside of some limited python knowledge. Hopefully this goes well!

## Start of Day 1

My environment is set up on my work and home computers and tested with the usual 'hello world,' everything seems to be working!

I'd like to learn to do some basic input and output, maybe throw together a little hangman game or something like that... we'll see.

I am following along with some of the tutorials on this website because they're seemingly pretty straightforward and decent at explaining the basics without freaking me out: https://www.guru99.com/c-programming-tutorial.html

Learning string comparisons: very different from python. 'strcmp' lets me compare two strings for matching contents and returns '0' if things match. No more [ if x == y ] for everything under the sun, probably a good thing to get used to...

Our very first segmentation fault! No idea what exactly is causing it! 'strcmp' doesn't seem to be working exactly right at the moment, so I copypasta'd some stackoverflow code which said it was a copy of 'strcmp' and now we get a segmentation fault when entering a string for comparison. Very cool!

## Start of Day 2 (non sequential days)

Learning about arrays today for the rest of this hangman game. Need to learning how to build an array of nothing and fill it with user input, THEN compare it to the string of the hangman word...

Learning more about string comparison and iteration, nowhere near as simple as python, but interesting seeing how arrays are handled and what built-in functions exist for comparisons.

Very tired today T.T

## Day 3!

Stole some very complex pointer arithmetic from stackoverflow and it only broke my brain for a few minutes before finings this: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_operators.htm

The code I stole:

char * index = strchr(str, c);
int pos = index ? index - str : -1;

That second line specifically is still kind of hard to wrap my brain around.

'int pos' defines the variable
it's being set equal to 'index - str' IF 'index' is true, otherwise it is being set equal to -1

@_@

I need to get a better understanding of arrays... Trying to dynamically fill with "blanks" an array that matches the length of the word.
