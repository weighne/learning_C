		<p>I want to try and keep notes for every day that I work on something in C until I feel that I'm about as competent as I am in Python (not very, but just enough to pretend I am).</p>
    <h3>// Day 1</h3>
    <p>My environment is set up on my work and home computers and tested with the usual 'hello world,' everything seems to be working!<br>

    I'd like to learn to do some basic input and output, maybe throw together a little hangman game or something like that... we'll see.<br>

    I am following along with some of the tutorials on <a href="https://www.guru99.com/c-programming-tutorial.html">this website</a> because they're seemingly pretty straightforward and decent at explaining the basics without freaking me out.<br>

    Learning string comparisons: very different from python. <b>strcmp</b> lets me compare two strings for matching contents and returns '0' if things match. No more <b>[ if x == y ]</b> for everything under the sun, probably a good thing to get used to... <br>

    Our very first segmentation fault! <br>No idea what exactly is causing it! <b>strcmp</b> doesn't seem to be working exactly right at the moment, so I copypasta'd some stackoverflow code which said it was a copy of <b>strcmp</b> and now we get a segmentation fault when entering a string for comparison.<br> Very cool! <br>
